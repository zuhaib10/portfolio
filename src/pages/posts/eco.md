## Introduction

When I started working on my blog, my goal was clear: to create a simple, lightweight, and energy-efficient theme that doesnâ€™t overload the browser while maintaining a minimalist aesthetic. Thatâ€™s how **Low Power Blog** was bornâ€”a theme for **Astro** focused on performance, readability, and resource efficiency.

## Why Astro?

Astro is a modern static site generator that allows for the creation of fast and optimized websites with minimal rendering overhead. It was the perfect fit for my **Low Power Blog** concept because:

- It loads only the necessary code (zero JS by default).
- It supports **MDX** and **Markdown**, making blogging seamless.
- It easily integrates with various tools and optimizations.

## Key Features of Low Power Blog

The **Low Power Blog** theme was designed with simplicity and speed in mind. Here are its main features:

âœ… **Minimalist monochrome design** â€” clean and distraction-free.

âœ… **Lightweight and fast loading** â€” CSS without unnecessary dependencies and minimized resources.

âœ… **Tag system** â€” convenient content organization for structured browsing.

âœ… **Astro content collections** â€” simplified management of articles and pages.

âœ… **Energy-efficient images** â€” images converted to grayscale to reduce power consumption, implemented using **astro-imagetools**.

âœ… **Responsive grid layout** â€” optimized content display across all devices.

## Installation and Setup

If you're interested in trying out this theme, you can install it and test it easily:

```bash
npm install
npm install astro-imagetools
npm run dev  # Start in development mode
npm run build  # Build the project
npm run preview  # Preview the build
```

## Project Structure

- `/src/content/blog/` â€” Blog posts
- `/src/content/page/` â€” Static pages
- `/public/images/` â€” Image assets

## Conclusion

**Low Power Blog** is not just a theme for Astro, but an attempt to make the web cleaner, faster, and more user-friendly. If you'd like to try this theme or suggest improvementsâ€”you're welcome!
