# Freaky Font: A Bold Typeface for Designers & Developers
![font freaky](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/temaprint/fontfreaky/main/public/fontfreaky.png)
## Introduction

Typography plays a crucial role in design, and sometimes, the perfect font is hidden within Unicode characters, inaccessible in common formats like **TTF** or **SVG**. That’s why we created **Freaky Font**—a custom typeface inspired by Math Bold Script-like fonts, designed to be accessible and easy to use for both designers and developers.

## The Problem We Set Out to Solve

### ❌ Limited Accessibility
Fonts like **Math Bold Script** exist only in Unicode and can only be rendered in specialized environments, making them difficult to use in practical design and development workflows.

### ❌ No Ready Formats
Before **Freaky Font**, there was no **TTF** or **SVG** version available, limiting its usability across different platforms and applications.

### ❌ Technical Barriers
Extracting or converting these fonts into scalable formats was nearly impossible with standard tools, making it inaccessible to a broader audience.

## Our Solution: Freaky Font

To address these challenges, we developed **Freaky Font**, a beautifully crafted typeface inspired by Math Bold Script, now available in:

✅ **TTF Format** – Installable on any system and compatible with design software.

✅ **SVG Format** – Scalable for web and graphic design projects.

Now, anyone can integrate this **bold and elegant** font style into their projects with ease!

## Installation

Installing **Freaky Font** is simple:

1. **Download** the font files (**TTF** and **SVG**) from the official repository.
2. **Install the TTF file** by double-clicking it and selecting **“Install”** on your system.
3. **Use the SVG version** in web projects or design tools that support vector fonts.

## Usage

🎨 **Design Applications:** Works seamlessly with **Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Figma, and Sketch**.

🌍 **Web Development:** Easily embeddable using **TTF** or **SVG**.

✨ **Creative Projects:** Ideal for **typography, branding, and graphic design**.
